## üåç The Problem: Hidden Computation in a Trustless World

### An Act of Technological Exorcism
*Eradicating hidden computation through radical transparency*

Modern computing is built on a foundation of hidden processes‚Äîdaemons, background services, and opaque binaries that operate without user consent or oversight. These hidden layers introduce three critical vulnerabilities:

First, security vulnerabilities emerge through privilege escalation, supply-chain attacks, and unverified code execution. Second, trust deficits grow as users cannot verify what their machines are actually doing. Third, resource abuse proliferates as undocumented processes consume memory, CPU, and network bandwidth.

In the age of AI, this problem becomes existential. As AI systems grow more complex, the risk of unaccountable computation increases exponentially. Without verifiable transparency, we risk ceding control to systems we cannot understand or trust.

The Zero Trust Computer (ZTC) stands as the only viable solution to this crisis‚Äîa solution that is not only revolutionary but also responsible, ethical, and empowering.

## üöÄ The Vision: A New Paradigm for Computing

ZTC transcends the traditional concept of an operating system‚Äîit represents a philosophical and technical revolution. By eliminating daemons, hidden processes, and opaque dependencies, ZTC enforces three fundamental standards:

1. Radical Transparency: Every instruction is cryptographically verified and auditable.
2. Zero Trust Architecture: No process runs without explicit, verifiable consent.
3. Sovereign Control: Users retain full ownership of their hardware and software.

This is computing as it was meant to be: trustless, transparent, and tamper-proof.

## üèõÔ∏è Constitutional Architecture

ZTC rests on four foundational pillars, each enforced at both hardware and software levels:

### 1. No Hidden State
**Enforcement**: TPM-backed memory attestation
**Mechanism**: All memory states are cryptographically hashed and verified before execution.

### 2. Zero Ambient Authority
**Enforcement**: Quantum-resistant capability tokens
**Mechanism**: Processes require explicit, revocable permissions to access resources.

### 3. Non-Byzantine Communication
**Enforcement**: Graphene-Chain Protocol
**Mechanism**: All inter-process communication is logged and verified via Merkle proofs.

### 4. Continuous Proof-of-Intent
**Enforcement**: SNARK-based action justifications
**Mechanism**: Every instruction must be accompanied by a zero-knowledge proof of its legitimacy.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Core Verification Principle

At the heart of ZTC lies a Rust-based verification engine that ensures every instruction is accountable:

```rust
fn execute_instruction(proof: CryptographicProof) -> Result<Action, SystemHalt> {
    if !proof.validate_chain_of_custody() {
        burn_circuit!(); // Hardware-enforced termination
    }
    // Proceed with execution
}
```

This principle ensures that no computation occurs without proof of legitimacy.

## ‚öñÔ∏è License Structure: Protecting Freedom

ZTC is licensed under GNU AGPLv3+ with additional clauses to ensure its principles are preserved:

### Elimination of Proprietary Daemons Clause
All derivative works must:
1. Maintain daemonless architecture
2. Provide cryptographic proofs of integrity for all components

### Why AGPLv3+?
- Corporate Vampirism Prevention: Mandates sharing security-critical modifications
- Networked Transparency: AGPL's ¬ß13 enforces service operator accountability
- Temporal Protection: "Or any later version" future-proofs freedom

## ü©∫ Contribution Protocol

To prevent license corruption and ensure code integrity, contributions must follow a strict protocol:

1. Submit Intentions: Via RFC 9381 format
2. Accompany with Proof: SMT-based proof of non-regression
3. Undergo Review: Live-streamed code review ceremony

## üîí Compliance Requirements

ZTC is proactively designed to comply with global standards, ensuring responsible and ethical deployment:

- Wassenaar Arrangement: Restricts distribution to embargoed countries
- GDPR: Empowers users with full data control and deletion rights
- CCPA: Provides California residents with data transparency
- Tallinn Manual 2.0: Commits to Peace, Truth, and Cyber Transparency
- Budapest Convention: Cooperates with cybercrime prevention efforts
- NIST SP 800-207: Implements Zero Trust Architecture at every level

## üåê Why ZTC is the Future

In a world increasingly dominated by AI and opaque systems, ZTC represents the only answer to the crisis of trust in computing. It is not merely software‚Äîit is an immunological response to computational malignancy, ensuring that every instruction, every process, and every byte remains accountable to its users.
