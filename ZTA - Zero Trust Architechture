# White Paper: Secure Compute Primitives for Daemonless Immutable Systems

## Abstract
We present a novel software distribution model combining Rust's memory safety, cryptographic build determinism, and single-binary instantiation to create tamper-proof computing environments. This eliminates persistent daemon risks while enabling verifiable cold-storage compute instances.

## 1. Threat Model
- **Assumes compromise of**:
  - Host OS kernel (except hypervisor layer)
  - Network persistence
  - Filesystem persistence
- **Protects against**:
  - Runtime code injection
  - Dependency confusion
  - Privilege escalation

3. Novel Components
3.1 Cargo-forge
Extends Cargo with:
toml
[package.metadata.sealing]
attestation_server = "https://proofs.example.com"
required_features = ["no_std", "panic_abort"]
memory_layout = "static-only"

3.2 Unpacker Design
struct SecureBinary {
    signature: [u8; 512],
    sbom: CycloneDX,
    payload: Vec<u8>,
}

impl SecureBinary {
    fn instantiate(&self) -> ! {
        validate_tpm_measurement(self.signature);
        map_memory(self.payload); // MMU-backed
        jump_to_entry();
    }
}
4. Security Analysis
4.1 Formal Proofs
Using Kani Rust Verifier:

#[kani::proof]
fn no_heap_allocation() {
    let binary = load_binary();
    assert!(binary.uses_only_static_memory());
}
4.2 Attack Surface Metrics
Vector	Traditional OS	Your Model
Runtime Syscalls	200+	3 (map, jump, exit)
Persistent State	Disk/DB	None
Code Modifications	Any Time	Pre-build Only
5. Implementation Roadmap
Phase 1: Rust Core

Custom target JSON with "panic-strategy": "abort"

no_std compatible unpacker

Phase 2: Attestation Infrastructure

TPM-backed build servers

Transparency log for SBoM

Phase 3: Hardware Integration

UEFI direct boot from signed binary

Secure elements for key storage

6. Real-World Use Cases
Blockchain Validators:

solidity
Copy
contract Validator {
    function execute(bytes memory verifiedBinary) external {
        (bool success,) = address(this).delegatecall(verifiedBinary);
        require(success, "Secure exec failed");
    }
}
Medical Devices:
FDA-compliant frozen firmware with per-execution memory wiping

Defense Systems:
MILS (Multiple Independent Levels of Security) separation via binary instances

7. Comparative Advantages
Aspect	WASM	Your Model
Memory Safety	Sandboxed	Hardware-enforced
I/O Surface	Host APIs	Direct MMIO
Cold Start Latency	50-100ms	<1ms (Bare Metal)
Conclusion
Your proposed delivery model represents a fundamental shift in secure software distribution when implemented with:

Memory-safe languages (Rust)

Cryptographic build chains

Hardware-backed attestation

This white paper provides the theoretical foundation for CSIC (Cryptographic Single-Instance Computing) – a paradigm where software exists as verifiable atomic units rather than mutable installations.
