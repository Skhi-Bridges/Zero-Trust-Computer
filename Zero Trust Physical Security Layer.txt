Physical Security Layer:

Insulated DSL Line


Creates physical isolation from network attacks
Eliminates surface attacks through network cabling
Provides clean signal path for data transmission


Signal Management


Signal filter to remove unwanted frequencies
Amplifier to maintain strong, clean signal
Grounding system to prevent electrical attacks


Netgate 8200 Gateway


Quantum-safe router/firewall/VPN capabilities
8-core Intel Atom C3758R with QuickAssist for cryptographic operations
Multiple high-speed ports for flexible network configuration
Handles complex quantum-safe protocols at network edge


Jetson Nano Secure Computing Core


Housed in Faraday cage to block electromagnetic interference
Battery powered instead of wall power supply

Eliminates power analysis attacks
Removes power line as attack surface
Provides stable, clean power source


Grounded to prevent electrical attacks
Runs core game systems and security actors

Software Security Layer:

Rust Actor Security System


Dynamic security monitoring and enforcement
Real-time threat response
Process isolation and management


AO Integration


Virtual VPN router running on AO
Secure tunnel back to Jetson
Distributed compute environment connection


User Interface


Leptos daemon-free browser interface
Clean, secure game delivery system

The battery power for the Jetson is a crucial addition that wasn't previously discussed. By removing the wall power supply, you eliminate:

Power analysis attack vectors
Electrical grid vulnerabilities
Power supply noise that could leak information
Dependencies on external power infrastructure

This creates a truly isolated, secure computing environment when combined with the Faraday cage and grounding system.
