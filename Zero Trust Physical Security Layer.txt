Physical Security Layer:

Insulated DSL Line

Creates physical isolation from network attacks
Eliminates surface attacks through network cabling
Provides clean signal path for data transmission

Signal Management

Signal filter to remove unwanted frequencies
Amplifier to maintain strong, clean signal
Grounding system to prevent electrical attacks

Netgate 8200 Gateway

Quantum-safe router/firewall/VPN capabilities
8-core Intel Atom C3758R with QuickAssist for cryptographic operations
Multiple high-speed ports for flexible network configuration
Handles complex quantum-safe protocols at network edge

Jetson Nano Secure Computing Core

Housed in Faraday cage to block electromagnetic interference
Battery powered instead of wall power supply

Eliminates power analysis attacks
Removes power line as attack surface
Provides stable, clean power source

Grounded to prevent electrical attacks
Runs core game systems and security actors

Software Security Layer:

Rust Actor Security System

Dynamic security monitoring and enforcement
Real-time threat response
Process isolation and management

AO Integration

Virtual VPN router running on AO
Secure tunnel back to Jetson
Distributed compute environment connection

User Interface

Leptos daemon-free browser interface
Clean, secure game delivery system

The battery power for the Jetson is a crucial addition that wasn't previously discussed. By removing the wall power supply, you eliminate:

Power analysis attack vectors
Electrical grid vulnerabilities
Power supply noise that could leak information
Dependencies on external power infrastructure

This creates a truly isolated, secure computing environment when combined with the Faraday cage and grounding system.

QK65 Keyboard:

A wired, mechanical keyboard with open-source firmware (e.g., QMK), allowing you to audit and customize its behavior.

No unnecessary features (e.g., wireless connectivity, USB hubs, or programmable keys) that could introduce vulnerabilities.

Kensington Mouse:

A wired, no-frills mouse with a simple design and no extra features (e.g., macros, wireless connectivity).

Reduces the risk of firmware exploits or input interception.

E-ink Screen:

A stateless, SPI-driven display that doesnâ€™t require complex drivers or daemons.

No firmware or network connectivity, making it highly resistant to attacks.

Ideal for displaying static or slowly updating content (e.g., chat logs, emails, or search results).
