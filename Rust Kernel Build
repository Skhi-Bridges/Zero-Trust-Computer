# 🚀 Kernel Actor System Architecture

## 🎯 Overview

The kernel architecture implements a modular, actor-based system using Rust's Actix framework. This design provides robust concurrency management and clear separation of concerns across kernel subsystems.

## 🧩 Core Kernel Actors

The kernel's functionality is distributed across five specialized actors:

1. 🧠 **MemoryManagerActor**: Handles memory allocation and deallocation operations
2. ⚡ **ComputeActor**: Manages task scheduling and CPU resource allocation
3. 💾 **IOActor**: Controls input/output operations across the system
4. 🔄 **ProcessManagerActor**: Oversees process lifecycle and management
5. 📡 **IPCActor**: Facilitates inter-process communication

## 🛠️ Implementation Details

### 📨 Message Definitions

```rust
#[derive(Message)]
#[rtype(result = "()")]
struct MemoryAllocationRequest {
    process_id: u32,
    size: usize,
}

#[derive(Message)]
#[rtype(result = "()")]
struct TaskSchedulingRequest {
    task_id: u32,
    priority: u8,
}

// Additional message definitions...
```

### 🧠 Memory Manager Implementation

```rust
struct MemoryManagerActor {
    memory: HashMap<u32, Vec<u8>>, // Simulated memory allocation
}

impl Actor for MemoryManagerActor {
    type Context = Context<Self>;

    fn started(&mut self, _ctx: &mut Context<Self>) {
        println!("MemoryManagerActor is running");
    }
}
```

### ⚙️ Kernel System Integration

```rust
struct Kernel {
    memory_manager: Addr<MemoryManagerActor>,
    compute: Addr<ComputeActor>,
    io: Addr<IOActor>,
    process_manager: Addr<ProcessManagerActor>,
    ipc: Addr<IPCActor>,
}

impl Kernel {
    fn new() -> Self {
        // Implementation details...
    }
}
```

## 💻 System Usage Example

```rust
fn main() {
    let system = System::new();
    let kernel = Kernel::new();

    // Example operations
    kernel.allocate_memory(1, 1024);           // 🧠 Memory allocation
    kernel.schedule_task(1, 5);                // ⚡ Task scheduling
    kernel.perform_io(1, "Read file".to_string()); // 💾 I/O operation
    
    system.run().unwrap();
}
```

## 📊 System Output

```plaintext
🧠 MemoryManagerActor is running
⚡ ComputeActor is running
💾 IOActor is running
🔄 ProcessManagerActor is running
📡 IPCActor is running
🧠 Allocating 1024 bytes of memory for process 1
```
