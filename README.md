**An Act of Technological Exorcism**  
*Eradicating hidden computation through radical transparency*

## üåç Dissertation
> "Daemons are the original sin of computing - hidden processes manipulating reality without consent.  
> This project implements Carl Sagan's imperative:  
> *'Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof'*  
> applied at the machine instruction level."

## üìú Constitutional Architecture
```rust
// Core Verification Principle
fn execute_instruction(proof: CryptographicProof) -> Result<Action, SystemHalt> {
    if !proof.validate_chain_of_custody() {
        burn_circuit!(); // Hardware-enforced termination
    }
    // ...
}
Foundational Pillars
Principle	Enforcement Mechanism
No Hidden State	TPM-backed Memory Attestation
Zero Ambient Authority	Quantum-Resistant Capability Tokens
Non-Byzantine Communication	Graphene-Chain Protocol
Continuous Proof-of-Intent	SNARK-based Action Justifications
