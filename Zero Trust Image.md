White Paper: Zero Trust Image 
Quantum Cryptographic Immutability for Secure Build Image Distribution
🎯 Abstract
This paper introduces Zero Trust Image (ZTI), a secure method for distributing build images using post-quantum cryptographic primitives like CRYSTALS-Kyber (for encryption) and CRYSTALS-Dilithium (for signing). ZTI ensures that build images are cryptographically immutable, tamper-proof, and verifiable at every stage of transfer. This is a critical component of a larger Cryptographic Single-Instance Computing (CSIC) framework, enabling secure, daemonless, and immutable system execution.

🛡️ Threat Model
Assumptions
The build environment is trusted (e.g., SGX enclave or air-gapped system).

The delivery channel is fully adversarial (e.g., MITM attacks, compromised servers).

The host system may be compromised, but hardware-backed attestation is available.

Protections
🚫 Tampering: Ensures the image cannot be modified during transfer.

🔒 Secrecy: Encrypts the image to prevent unauthorized access.

✅ Authenticity: Verifies the image’s origin and integrity.

⏳ Future-Proofing: Uses post-quantum cryptography to resist quantum attacks.

🔧 Core Components
1. Post-Quantum Cryptographic Primitives
CRYSTALS-Kyber: Used for encryption to ensure the image remains confidential during transfer.

CRYSTALS-Dilithium: Used for signing to ensure the image’s authenticity and integrity.

// Example: Signing the image with Dilithium
let signature = dilithium::sign(&private_key, &image);

// Example: Encrypting the image with Kyber
let (ciphertext, shared_secret) = kyber::encrypt(&public_key, &image);
2. Cryptographic Image Format
The image is packaged into a self-contained, cryptographically secure format:

[ZTI Image Format]
1. Header: Metadata (e.g., version, timestamp, SBoM hash)  
2. Payload: Encrypted image (Kyber)  
3. Signature: Dilithium signature of the header + payload  
4. Attestation: Hardware-backed attestation report (optional)  
3. Hardware-Backed Attestation
The image is signed in a trusted execution environment (e.g., SGX, TPM).

The attestation report is included to prove the image was built in a secure environment.

# Generate attestation report
tpm_attestation --image my_image.bin --output attestation.json

🚀 Zero Trust Image Transfer Workflow

1. Build Phase
The image is built in a secure environment (e.g., SGX enclave).

The image is signed with Dilithium and encrypted with Kyber.

cargo build --release --locked
sign_image --key dilithium_private.pem --image my_image.bin
encrypt_image --key kyber_public.pem --image my_image.bin

2. Delivery Phase
The image is distributed over any channel (HTTP, USB, etc.).

The recipient verifies the Dilithium signature and decrypts the image using their Kyber private key.

verify_image --key dilithium_public.pem --image my_image.bin
decrypt_image --key kyber_private.pem --image my_image.bin

3. Execution Phase
The image is unpacked into memory and executed in a hardware-backed environment.

The attestation report is verified to ensure the image is running in a secure context.

tpm_attestation --verify --image my_image.bin
execute_image --memory_only my_image.bin


🔐 Quantum Cryptographic Immutability

Why It Matters
Quantum Resistance: CRYSTALS-Kyber and CRYSTALS-Dilithium are designed to resist attacks from quantum computers.

Immutable Builds: The image cannot be modified without invalidating the signature.

End-to-End Security: The image remains secure from build to execution.

🧩 How This Fits Into the Larger CSIC Framework

ZTIT is one piece of the Cryptographic Single-Instance Computing (CSIC) puzzle. Here’s how it fits:

Build:

The image is built in a secure environment and signed with Dilithium.

The image is encrypted with Kyber for secure transfer.

Transfer:

The image is distributed using ZTIT, ensuring it cannot be tampered with.

Execution:

The image is unpacked and executed in a hardware-backed environment.

The attestation report ensures the image is running securely.

Lifetime:

The image is immutable and stateless, eliminating runtime tampering risks.

🏆 What ZTIT Accomplishes

Secure Distribution: The image can be transferred over any channel without risk of tampering.

Quantum Resistance: The image is protected against both classical and quantum attacks.

Immutability: The image cannot be modified after it is built.

Verifiability: The image’s origin and integrity can be verified at every stage.

🌐 Conclusion

Zero Trust Image Transfer (ZTIT) is a critical component of the Cryptographic Single-Instance Computing (CSIC) framework. By leveraging post-quantum cryptographic primitives like CRYSTALS-Kyber and CRYSTALS-Dilithium, ZTIT ensures that build images are secure, immutable, and verifiable during transfer.

This piece completes the build-to-transfer phase of CSIC, laying the foundation for secure execution in a daemonless, immutable environment. Together, these components create a new paradigm for high-assurance computing in the quantum era.
